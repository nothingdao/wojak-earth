# 🌍 Wojak Earth

_Community-First MMO with Crypto-Ready Infrastructure_

## What We're Building

A social exploration MMO where players mine, trade, craft, and build communities across interconnected worlds. We've built complete crypto infrastructure - but **none of it is active**. Instead, we're focused on creating engaging social experiences that make players want to log in every day.

**Our approach:** Build the best possible game first. Add economics when the community asks for them.

## What Makes This Different

### 1. **Community-Driven Timeline**

Features activate based on player demand and engagement metrics, not arbitrary roadmap dates or funding pressure.

### 2. **Technical Excellence First**

Our crypto infrastructure is production-ready, but we're proving game quality and community engagement before activating economic features.

### 3. **Sustainable by Design**

When economics do activate, they're designed to enhance gameplay and community building, not replace them with financial speculation.

> 💡 **Investment Perspective:** Our [pitch deck](./PITCHDECK.md) explains why patient capital wins in crypto gaming.
