# ASTRDS Economy Design

## North Star

> The economic structure of ASTRDS should be self-evident to players — they can see it happening.

Every mechanic should be:
- Observable — visible in-game, not hidden in a dashboard
- Verifiable — on-chain, not trusted to an admin
- Intuitive — players understand why their earnings just changed

The game IS the dashboard.

---

## What ASTRDS Is

A native game token earned by playing. No team allocation. 100% earned through gameplay.

ASTRDS has no circulating premine. The fixed supply starts in a program-owned emission reserve. Tokens can only leave the reserve through gameplay settlement, and missed allocation is burned from the reserve.

Deposited shitcoins are separate — chaotic, social, player-driven. Not part of the ASTRDS economic design.

---

## Supply

- Fixed supply: 21,000,000 ASTRDS minted once into the program-owned emission vault
- Allocation per settled game: up to 50 ASTRDS
- Total games to full emission: 420,000 at 50 ASTRDS/game
- Total cash inflow at full emission: $105,000
- Emission unit: pills collected during a game
- Uncollected allocation: burned from the emission vault at settlement via a real SPL burn
- Earned allocation accumulates in the player's on-chain `PlayerEmission` claimable balance until claimed

---

## Liquidity Layer — Meteora DAMM v2

The market and liquidity layer is a **Meteora DAMM v2 pool: ASTRDS/SOL**.

- Pool is seeded at launch with minimum SOL to establish starting price
- Every quarter's `buyback_bps` slice (SOL) accumulates in the `BuybackVault` PDA
- A permissionless `crank_liquidity` instruction flushes accumulated SOL: wraps it, swaps half → ASTRDS, adds two-sided liquidity to the pool, permanently locks the position
- LP position owned by the vault is permanently locked — liquidity is never withdrawable
- All subsequent price movement is organic from gameplay
- SOL/USD price read from the shared Convex `/prices/sol-usd` endpoint (Coinbase → Binance → CoinGecko fallback, 60s cache) to derive USD-denominated emission tiers

**crank_liquidity = buyback + LP in one crank.** The instruction swaps half the accumulated SOL to ASTRDS (buying from the pool) and adds both sides as balanced liquidity. Net effect: every quarter deepens the pool and supports price — just asynchronously rather than inline.

**Why DAMM v2:**
- Token-2022 compatible (ASTRDS is Token-2022)
- Open source
- Supports locked/permanently locked liquidity natively
- Simpler than DLMM — no concentrated liquidity complexity needed at this stage

---

## Pricing Model

Price is determined by the AMM pool ratio — no oracle needed.

```
price_sol  = sol_reserve / astrds_reserve   (live from DAMM v2 pool)
price_usd  = price_sol × sol_usd_price      (Convex price endpoint, 60s cache)
```

Pool depth grows with every quarter (SOL deposited → LP locked). Burn pressure reduces circulating supply, reducing sell pressure on the pool. Both forces support price over time.

```
                ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
                │  price_usd = (sol_reserve /           │
                │               astrds_reserve)         │
                │               × sol_usd_price         │
                └──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                               │
            ┌──────────────────┴───────────────────┐
            │                                      │
    sol_reserve grows                      sell pressure falls
    (quarters → pool)                    (burns → less circulating)
            │                                      │
       ─────────                             ──────────
       quarters                             missed pills
```

## Emission Tiers (Procyclical)

The 50 ASTRDS allocation per game is fixed. Price determines how many pills carry it and at what denomination. Higher price = more pills spawned = more skill required to capture the full allocation.

| Price (derived) | Pills spawned | ASTRDS per pill | Full capture earns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 (floor) | 5 | 10 | 50 |
| Tier 2 | 10 | 5 | 50 |
| Tier 3 | 25 | 2 | 50 |
| Tier 4 | 50 | 1 | 50 |
| Tier 5 (ceiling) | 100 | 0.5 | 50 |

Price breakpoints are **variable** — to be calibrated at mainnet launch against real seeded liquidity. Current table is structural, not final.

Tiers move up and down fluidly as price crosses bands. Not a one-way ratchet.

**Why procyclical:**
- Price up → more pills spawn → harder to capture all 50 → more burns → less sell pressure → price up further
- Price down → fewer pills → less sell pressure from new emissions → natural emission brake

**Emission is now server-authoritative.** The game server refreshes Convex admin config, reads the pool at session start, locks in the emission tier for that session, and enforces the pill cap. The client cannot influence emission rate.

---

## The Quarter

- Cost per game: ~$0.25 in SOL
- Split weights are on-chain, publicly visible, admin-adjustable without program upgrade
- Target split (to be finalized at mainnet):
  - **Operational** — Railway, Helius, RPC, game server costs
  - **Operator** — fee to the entity running the game server
  - **Pool** — single-sided SOL deposit into the Meteora DAMM v2 pool (buyback + LP combined)

The pool slice accumulates in the `BuybackVault` PDA. A permissionless `crank_liquidity` instruction (separate tx) flushes accumulated SOL into Meteora — swap half → ASTRDS, add two-sided LP, permanently lock. Anyone can crank; the vault enforces the mechanics on-chain.

## Operational Sustainability

Total inflow at full emission (420,000 games × $0.25): **$105,000**

Revenue from operational split accumulates proportionally to games played — not time. The operation is self-funding from gameplay volume.

Costs (to be confirmed once infra is running at scale):
- Railway (game server)
- Helius API
- Convex
- RPC
- Netlify

Operational split % adjusted once real costs are known. Structure does not change.

---

## Variables (All Admin-Adjustable)

Everything soft. Structure hard.

**On-chain (trustless — target state):**
- Revenue split weights and slice destinations
- DAMM v2 pool address (stored in VaultConfig for CPI target)
- Hard supply cap (21M) *(target — not yet enforced on-chain)*
- Allocation per game (50 ASTRDS) *(target — currently enforced by game server config/tier caps)*
- Per-wallet cooldown / rate limiting *(target — currently Convex/game-server enforced)*

**Convex admin config (current live state):**
- Quarter price display/payment target
- Emission tier bands (price breakpoints)
- Pills per tier, ASTRDS per pill per tier
- Ship, bullet, asteroid, pickup, and Space Token opportunity tuning
- Persisted level-band progression policies

**Convex game state:**
- Session lifecycle, scores, leaderboard
- Space deposit pools, spawn tickets, collections, claims
- Chat
- Off-chain ASTRDS allocation/earned/burned accounting per game session

**Game server (authoritative):**
- Emission tier enforcement (refreshes config, reads pool at session start, locks tier for session)
- Pill cap enforcement
- Progression policy enforcement
- Score, pills, and token collection written to Convex

## Roadmap

```
NOW (devnet)
  ✓ Game server deployed — emission is server-authoritative
  ✓ Quarter payment splits on-chain (operational / operator / buyback)
  ✓ Buyback SOL accumulates in BuybackVault PDA per quarter
  ✓ crank_liquidity: swap half SOL → ASTRDS, add two-sided LP, permanently lock
  ✓ Emission tier read from live Meteora pool at session start
  ✓ Space token deposits, spawn tickets, collections, claims live
  ✓ Tokenomics overlay showing live pool state
  ✓ crank_liquidity verified end-to-end on devnet (game payment → buyback vault → LP add → permanent lock)
  ✓ Admin config/progression planner live via Convex-backed gameConfig
  → Finalize 3-way split percentages for mainnet

MAINNET
  → Seed DAMM v2 ASTRDS/SOL pool
  → LP tokens locked in vault PDA (permanently, verifiable on-chain)
  → Vault CPI into Meteora on every quarter payment
  → Emission tiers and split weights hardened on-chain
  → Price breakpoints calibrated against real seeded liquidity

FULL TRUSTLESS
  → All economic state on-chain
  → Convex handles only game state (sessions, scores, chat, leaderboard)
  → Players can verify everything without trusting anyone
```

## Parked / Decided

**Buyback mechanism → single-sided LP deposit**
A separate buyback step (swap SOL → ASTRDS via Jupiter) is unnecessary. A single-sided SOL deposit into the Meteora DAMM pool achieves the same price support effect — the pool internally swaps half the incoming SOL to ASTRDS to balance the deposit. Combined buyback+LP in one operation, one CPI, one transaction.

**LP token custody → vault PDA (locked forever)**
DAMM v2 supports permanently locked liquidity. LP tokens minted from pool deposits go to the vault PDA and are never redeemable. Liquidity is permanently locked — verifiable on-chain. Irreversibility is a feature.

**Quote asset → SOL**
SOL/USD price is fetched through the shared Convex price endpoint (Coinbase → Binance → CoinGecko fallback) to derive USD-denominated emission tiers. Devnet pool validated this approach.

**Pool → Meteora DAMM v2**
Token-2022 compatible, open source, locked liquidity support. DLMM rejected — concentrated liquidity adds complexity not needed at this stage.

**Emission tier breakpoints → variable**
To be calibrated at mainnet launch against real seeded liquidity. Current tier table is structural only.

**Revenue split → 3-way (operational / operator / pool)**
Operator slice added to support community-run game servers. Pool slice replaces separate buyback+LP. On-chain weights, no program upgrade needed to adjust percentages.

---

## Open Questions

- Exact price tier breakpoints (set at mainnet launch against real liquidity)
- Final revenue split percentages for each of the three slices
- Death spiral protection — is the floor tier (5 pills, 10 ASTRDS/pill) sufficient in a prolonged bear market
- Whether the `meteora-damm-rust-sdk` crate should be pinned to a specific commit for build stability
- Operator whitelist design for community servers (trusted vs. open)
